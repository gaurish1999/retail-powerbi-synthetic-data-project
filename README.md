Power BI dashboard demonstrating retail analytics built on an AI‑generated synthetic dataset. Includes DAX measures, screenshots, and a short case study.

## Dataset Disclosure
This is a Power BI report that demonstrates end‑to‑end retail analytics using a fully AI‑generated synthetic dataset. The project showcases data modeling, DAX measures, M code manipulation, interactive dashboard design, and example analyses (sales trends, segmentation, inventory health, etc.). No real customer or proprietary data was used; the dataset was generated for targeted usecases to mimic realistic retail patterns for learning and demonstration purposes.
